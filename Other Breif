Other Brief:
Many other algorithms can be used to generate more natural-looking terrain. I am going to discuss each algorithm in brief:
1) Perlin Noise and Simplex Noise:
These algorithms produce realistic patterns by generating random variations that are smooth over a 2D or 3D grid. They work wonderfully to form a landscape's basic contours.
Pros:
Excellent for quickly creating big, varied terrains; efficient and simple to apply.
Cons: 
Doesn't accurately depict little features or realistic processes like erosion.
2) Fractal Algorithms:
The technique creates hilly or mountainous landscapes by dividing the grid into smaller portions and then averaging and perturbing the data.
Pros: 
Effectively produces rough, mountainous terrain; produces a variety of landscapes.
Cons: 
The results lack the organic flow of genuine landscapes and might be repetitious.
3) Wavelet Noise:
It creates noise that is smoother and less grid-like than conventional Perlin noise by using wavelet modifications.
Pros: 
Detailed, smooth terrain with a reduced tendency to show patterns or artifacts.
Cons: 
Difficult to build than simple methods for noise.
4) Erosion Algorithm:
Landscapes are shaped throughout time by natural forces like wind, water, and gravity, which erosion algorithms replicate. By simulating the movements of water, silt, and material, they alter the height map of a terrain. For instance, in hydraulic erosion, water moves across the topography, eroding the higher regions and depositing silt in the lower regions to create the appearance of actual riverbeds and valleys.
Pros: 
Realism, Dynamic Details and Adaptability
Cons:
Computationally Intensive, might be time-consuming and more challenging to implement

Conclusion:
Erosion algorithms replicate the processes that gradually sculpt the Earth's surface, which is essential for creating terrain that appears natural. The addition of erosion effects can make terrain more dynamic, realistic, and detailed, making it ideal for a variety of uses in computer graphics, games, and simulations.
